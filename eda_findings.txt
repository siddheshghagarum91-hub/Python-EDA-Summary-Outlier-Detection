Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the student performance dataset to understand data distribution, detect outliers, and identify relationships between variables.

The dataset contains student demographic, academic, and activity-related features. Initial inspection showed correct data types and no critical missing values in the key numeric columns.

Descriptive statistics were generated for Age, StudyTimeWeekly, Absences, and GPA. GPA values were generally within a reasonable academic range, while Absences showed higher variability among students.

Histograms and boxplots were used to visualize data distribution. Boxplots indicated the presence of outliers in the GPA column.

Outliers were detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Extreme GPA values outside the lower and upper bounds were identified as outliers.

Outlier handling was performed using the capping method to preserve student records while limiting the effect of extreme values.

Correlation analysis showed:
- GPA has a positive correlation with weekly study time.
- GPA has a negative correlation with number of absences.
- Study time and absences show an inverse relationship.

The cleaned dataset was exported for further analysis and modeling.
